## Acknowledgments

I have to start by thanking my incredible wife, Silvia Veronica. Thank you so much, dear, for all your support and wise words. 

I dedicate my life's work to my daughter, a tiny 2-year old unreasonable creature that brings me to hope every day and teaches me that life could be a fun place.
